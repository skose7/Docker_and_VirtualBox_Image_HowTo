###Docker Container set up
https://docs.docker.com/reference/

#Install docker
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/

#In your terminal type: 
docker run -i -t ubuntu:latest /bin/bash

#After you see the '#' near your cursor a docker instance will have been initialised on your sytem.

#From here you can add programs/envs/dependencies to this environment by first doing:

apt-get update
apt-get install python3
test this installation with: python3 --version 
apt-get install vim/emacs etc
write a program and run it with vim to test python
apt-get install lshw to see system info w lshw -short

#Type exit to get out of your docker instance

#Now to keep this instance as you've set it up in the above steps you obtain the container ID with:

sudo docker ps â€“l

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND       CREATED         STATUS                     PORTS     NAMES
77e75670c057   ubuntu:latest   "/bin/bash"   8 minutes ago   Exited (0) 6 seconds ago    

#With the container ID you can now create an image of your docker instance with and name the image as you like: 
sudo docker commit 7e20d89ce838 ubuntu:base_skose

#You will then have to run the image before it appears as you've named it with docker ps -l: 
docker run -it ubuntu:base_skose
docker ps -l 
 
 #Now to share this container with others we do:
 docker save -o <path for generated tar file> <image name>

#For others to load this on their system they do the following: 
docker load < ubuntu_base_skose.tar
or 
docker load -i <path to image tar file>

#view images:
docker images

#To point docker to the directory with all samples files etc with:
docker run -v ~/Desktop/my_data:/my_data -it image_name
